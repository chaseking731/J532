<p class="leadGraph">Thomas (Oghenekome) Omorobe was born in Lagos, Nigeria where he would live for the first 17 years of his life before moving to America, but more specifically, Maryland. He found his love for sports Journalism in his first year of high school when he was still in Lagos, being a big fan of soccer played a big part in inspiring him to follow that path.</p>

<p>Thomas is now a junior at the University of Maryland studying at the <a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Philip Merril College College of Journalism</a>. He chose Maryland both for its proximity as well as its high level Journalism program, which would allow him to pursue his dream of sports writing.</p>

<p>Outside of Journalism, Thomas has another dream, that being to fly through the air, unlike his favorite superhero Batman who he likes for other reasons, like Christopher Nolan’s on screen interpretation. Thomas said he would want to fly because it seems like it would be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>One thing that is near and dear to Thomas is family, he highlighted Christmas with his extended family as his best time of his winter break and spending time with his Aunt who lived in Chicago was one of his favorite memories of the summer. For Christmas he got a nice pair of Nike shoes which he likes– although he likes Adidas more as a brand.</p>

<p>He also has strong opinions on vegetables with celery being absolute filth that he cannot stand and Carrots and Broccoli being favorites.</p>
